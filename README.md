# RichLinkPreviewMiddler

- generate HTML as a middler character for link preview between the providers(like Line, Facebook...) and the redirect links.
- these HTMLs with rich metadata in the head tag will redirect to the link where you wish to go.
- and the rich metadata will be crawled by the providers, and show the link preview.


## How to work
- you need to fill the structure.json, and execute the RichLinkPreviewMiddler.exe
